I ran into a bit of trouble recently with an irregularly sized conflat port, still working through it:

In pulling a vacuum in a chamber, it must be sealed from the surrounding atmosphere/air.  Otherwise the outside air will keep rushing in (a leak) as the vacuum pump(s) work and there'll never be a decent vacuum.  Calling it a leak would make you think the air is 'leaking' out of the vessel, but in vacuum context, a leak is air coming in.

For connecting components together, it's rarely enough to push two flat surfaces together and hope for the best.  For permanent or semi-permanent fixtures in relatively low vacuums, gluing or epoxying surfaces together can be a good enough seal.  For higher levels of vacuum, as in the Fusor, more sophisticated seals have been contrived, each catering to different pressures.  

Conflat is the gold standard for vacuum.  A conflat seal is made up of two unisex flanges, and a gasket.  The flanges have a narrow metal lip inset in the flange around the interior circumference.  The edge of the lip is called a knife edge.  A gasket, usually copper, but aluminium is sometimes used, viton too, fits snugly in the lips between the two flanges, which are bolted together, causing the knife edge to bite into the gasket on both sides and sealing the interior system from the outside.  A picture paints a thousand words:

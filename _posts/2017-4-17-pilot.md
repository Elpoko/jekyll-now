This site is taking over from tommccarthyprojects.com.  I didn't like Wordpress and wanted something more dev friendly -
 that I could play around with a bit.
 
 This site is running on Github Pages and Jekyll, which seem to be the handiest things to use.  I didn't do too much research, but
 these are working out nicely, so I'll stick at them.
 
 I plan on posting about the Fusor as it's being worked on (and some retrospective summaries of work done) and my other interests too, more
 of a Tom's website as opposed to a Fusor website.  Something along the lines of [Oliver Nash's](olivernash.org) and [Sam Zeloof's](sam.zeloof.xyz).
 
 The motivation for a site is something to keep a list and reference of whatever I'm doing.  I find I have no good reference for people
 when they ask what I'm up to.  This applies both to applications and day to day chat.
 
 Things to do:  
  - Set up custom domain.
  - Post about getting a mass flow controller working
  - Set up a separate website for my sports merchandise business, or contained within this, under custom domain ???
  - Link this base repo with the other themed repo OR just style this repo nicely and get rid of other one


Update 2-Sept-2017:  tommccarthyprojects.com is still going.  It's good to have an exclusive site for fusor-related info.

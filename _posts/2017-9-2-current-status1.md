I started sixth year this week, that's the final year of secondary school in Ireland, with exams at the end of the year.

The Fusor has 2-3 jobs left to do before completion, so it should be complete in the near future.  All that's left is to order deuterium and arrange the high voltage supply and install both.  

I've to figure out what I'm going to do for college - staying in Ireland or heading abroad.  I thought for a while last year that I mightn't start college at all, but I think it's best.  It gives me time to hang around and do what I want for a bit longer before taking on any real responsibilities.

I'm looking forward to finishing the Fusor.  There's a few things on my mind that I'd like to do, but I'm reluctant to start them as I want to make sure the Fusor is complete.  If I tear into new things without focusing on the Fusor, it'll never get finished.  Similar has happened in the past.  I'm not sure exactly what I want to do projects wise.  Smaller-scale than a Fusor for now anyways, do a couple of well-defined projects that take a few weeks or months each.  Some programming and business definitely, and probably a few physics/electronics construction and maybe maths too.  Itching to go.

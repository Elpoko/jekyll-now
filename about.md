I'm Tom, a teenager from Ireland.

I've set this website up to take over from another one, tommccarthyprojects.com, which deals mainly with my Fusor project.  I've got other projects and interests running too though, and there should be posts here about more than just the Fusor.  Fusor posts still run on [tommccarthyprojects.com](https://tommccarthyprojects.com/).

Some blogs I like the feel of:

* [Paul Graham](https://paulgraham.com)
* [Oliver Nash](https://olivernash.org)
* [Zach Holman](https://zachholman.com)

I wanted something simple for a blog/website, but also more open to experimentation than Wordpress, so this new departure is hosted on Github Pages and Jekyll.  Using Jekyll-Now to simplify things.
